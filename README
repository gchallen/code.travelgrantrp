---------------------
--- Prerequisites ---
---------------------

TGRP requires the following software.  Tested versions are in parentheses.

* Apache			http://apache.org/
  (You may be able to use another web server that works with PHP.)
* PHP version 5 or higher	http://php.net/
  - Including MySQL and GD support
  - PHP 5.2 or higher recommended
* MySQL version 5 or higher	http://mysql.org/
* PHP PEAR extensions		http://pear.php.net/

Apache is preloaded on most Linux distributions.  You may need to install
additional packages for PHP, MySQL, GD, and PEAR, such as:

* Fedora Linux: php-mysql, php-pear, php-gd
* Debian Linux: php5-common, php5-gd, php5-mysql, php-pear, 
  libapache2-mod-php5 (or libapache-mod-php5 for Apache 1.x)
* Ubuntu Linux: php5-common, php5-gd, php5-mysql, php-pear,
  libapache2-mod-php5 (or libapache-mod-php5 for Apache 1.x), and a package
  for SMTP support, such as postfix

You may need to restart the Apache web server after installing these
packages ("sudo apachectl graceful" or "sudo apache2ctl graceful").


---------------------
--- Configuration ---
---------------------

* Database configuration

  - Decide on a name for your database (no spaces allowed).

  - Run "sudo Code/createdb.sh" to create the database.  You may also run
    "sudo Code/createdb.sh OPTIONS" to pass options to MySQL, such as
    --user and --password.  Run "Code/createdb.sh --help" for more
    information.

    e.g. sudo Code/createdb.sh -uroot -psecret

* Site configuration

  - Edit "Code/options.inc", which is annotated to guide you.
    ("Code/createdb.sh" creates this file based on "Code/distoptions.inc".)
	 Mailing from the server requires a working email on the server. This
	 might require setting up a Mail Trasport Agent (e.g. sendmail).

  - Redirect Apache so your server URL will point at the TGRP directory.
    (If you get an Error 500, see "Configuration notes".)  This will
    generally require adding a <Directory> for the TGRP directory, and an
    Alias redirecting a particular URL to that directory.  For example,
    this section of httpd.conf makes the "/testconf" URL point at a TGRP
    installation in /home/anh/tgrp.

	<Directory "/home/anh/tgrp">
	        Options Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
	        AllowOverride all
	        Order allow,deny
	        Allow from all
	</Directory>
	Alias /testconf /home/anh/tgrp

    Note that the first argument to Alias should NOT end in a slash.  The
    "AllowOverride all" directive is required.

  - Update the systemwide setting for PHP's 'session.gc_maxlifetime'
    configuration variable.  This provides an upper bound on TGRP session
    lifetimes (the amount of idle time before a user is logged out
    automatically).  On Unix machines, systemwide PHP settings are often
    stored in '/etc/php.ini' ('/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini' on Debian LAMP).
	 The suggested value for this setting is 86400, e.g., 24 hours:

	 session.gc_maxlifetime = 86400

  - Disable PHP's magic quotes so that TGRP won't complain about it by
    changing the following line in your 'php.ini' (from On to Off):

	 magic_quotes_gpc = Off


  - An administration account has already been created:

    Email: admin@conf
    Password: admin

    Sign in with this account and change the default email and password.

    If your server configuration doesn't allow .htaccess files to set
    options, Apache will report an "Error 500" when you try to load TGRP.
    Change your Apache configuration to "AllowOverride All" in the TGRP
    directory, as our example does above.

    If your server shows you a directory listing rather than the TGRP
    homepage, add the following line to the <Directory>:

	        DirectoryIndex index.html index.php

  - You can set up everything else through the settings on the web site 
    itself. Please see the --- QUICK START GUIDE --- below.

* Configuration notes

  - Uploaded applications and reviews are limited in size by several PHP
    configuration variables, set by default to 20 megabytes in the base
    directory's ".htaccess".  You may want to lower them.

  - TGRP PHP scripts can take a lot of memory, particularly if they're
    doing things like generating MIME-encoded mail messages.  By default
    TGRP sets the PHP memory limit to 128MB.

  - TGRP uses Apache's mod_expires module; consider enabling it.

  - TGRP sets MySQL's max_allowed_packet variable based on the 
    upload_max_filesize set in the base directory's ".htaccess".



-------------------------
--- Quick Start Guide ---
-------------------------


1. Settings:
 
   - Home -> Settings -> Messages: Change conference abbreviation, 
	  name, and greetings.

   - Home -> Settings -> Submission: Open site for submission and 
	  set deadline.

   - Home -> Settings -> Reviews: Open site for review

   - Home -> Settings -> Decisions: Make sure the applicants can't 
	  see BOTH the decisions and granted amount, yet. (i.e., both 
	  selected options should be "No" at the moment).

2. Create Grant Chair (and other) Accounts:

   - Home -> Users -> Create Account: 
     + Grant Chair: Select 'Grant chair', CHECK 'System Admin'
	  + System Admin: Select 'Applicant', CHECK 'System Admin'
	  + Applicant: Select 'Applicant', UNCHECK 'System Admin'

3. Review Process:

   - Home -> All applications/Student applications/Postdoc applications 
	  -> (a specific) application:

     a) Download the resume, cover letter, and supervisor letter to 
	  review by clicking on the pdf icons.

     b) After the review, click on "Edit granted amount" and enter the 
	  amount. Even if the application is rejected, PUT 0 in the amount; 
	  this is to record that this application is reviewed. Then CLICK 
	  'save changes'.

     c) On the top left panel, click on Decision, then select granted 
	  or rejected.

     d) There is a comment panel where grant chairs can put their 
	  comments to discuss about the application. This comment section 
	  should be use for discussion instead of the review section.

	  *** Repeat steps a-d for other applications ***

4. Release Result: (When the review process is completed)

   - Home -> Settings -> Decisions: Select "Yes" for BOTH options, 
	  i.e., allowing the applicants to learn the decisions and granted 
	  amounts by logging in and checking their applications.
	  
   - Home -> Send mail: Use the prepared templates to send 
	  notifications to granted/rejected/all applicants.
